# VRLinkedObject is the parent class for custom links between {Application}s and external systems.
#
# An {Application} {RecordType} can be set as a linked record type, at which point it can specify a 
# VRLinkedObject to utilize. This subclass specifies the type of Entity ID to link to, the generation
# of linked information to display on the single_app view, and actions to take on the external system
# when a {Test} related to the {Application} in Vulnreport changes status.
